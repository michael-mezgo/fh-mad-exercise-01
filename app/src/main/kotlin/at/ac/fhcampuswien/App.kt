     *         1. `m`: The number of digits guessed correctly (regardless of their position).
     *         2. `n`: The number of digits guessed correctly and in the correct position.
     *         The result is formatted as "Output: m:n", where "m" and "n" represent the above values, respectively.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the inputs do not have the same number of digits.
